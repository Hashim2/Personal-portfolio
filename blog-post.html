                            <p>Lighting plays a crucial role in setting the mood and atmosphere of a horror game. Experiment with dynamic lighting effects, shadows, and flickering lights to create tension and suspense. Unity's built-in lighting system offers a range of features and tools to achieve realistic lighting effects. Check out Unity's official documentation on <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Lighting.html">Lighting</a> for detailed tutorials and tips.</p>

                            <p>Creating a haunting atmosphere is essential for immersing players in the world of your horror game. Use fog, particle effects, and environmental details to enhance the sense of dread and unease. Unity's Asset Store offers a wide range of atmospheric assets, including fog shaders, ambient soundscapes, and eerie textures.

                            <p>Sound design is a powerful tool for building tension and eliciting fear in players. Use ambient sounds, music, and sound effects to create a chilling auditory experience. Unity's Audio Mixer allows you to control and mix multiple audio sources in real-time, allowing for dynamic soundscapes and immersive audio environments. <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AudioMixer.html">Unity Audio Mixer Documentation</a>.

                            <p>Environmental storytelling involves conveying narrative elements through the game environment itself. Use props, set dressing, and environmental details to hint at the game's backstory and lore. Unity's Timeline and Cinemachine tools can be used to create cinematic sequences and scripted events that enhance the storytelling experience. <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/com.unity.timeline.html">Timeline Documentation</a> ,<a href="https://unity.com/unity/features/editor/art-and-design/cinemachine" >Unity Cinemachine Documentation</a></p>

                            <p>Building a horror game requires a variety of assets, including 3D models, textures, animations, and audio files. Unity's Asset Store and other online resources offer a wealth of assets to choose from. When selecting assets for your game, consider factors such as visual style, compatibility with Unity, and licensing agreements.

                            <h3>2.1 Player Vulnerability</h3>
                            <p>One of the key aspects of horror games is making the player feel vulnerable and powerless in the face of danger. Implement mechanics such as limited health, stamina, and resources to increase the sense of tension and fear. Consider incorporating mechanics that force players to make difficult choices, such as whether to fight or flee from enemies.</p>
                        </section>
                        <section>
                            <h3>2.2 Limited Resources</h3>
                            <p>Scarcity of resources, such as ammunition, health packs, and batteries, is a common feature in horror games. Limiting resources forces players to carefully manage their inventory and make strategic decisions about when to use items. Balancing resource scarcity is crucial to maintaining a challenging yet fair gameplay experience.</p>

                            <p>Stealth mechanics can add an extra layer of tension to horror games, allowing players to evade enemies and explore the environment undetected. Implement mechanics such as hiding spots, line of sight detection, and sound propagation to create a compelling stealth experience. Balance stealth with survival elements to create a dynamic and engaging gameplay loop.</p>

                            <p>Puzzles are a staple of horror games, serving as both obstacles to progress and narrative devices. Design puzzles that are thematically appropriate and integrated into the game world. Consider using environmental clues and cryptic symbolism to challenge players' problem-solving skills while enhancing the game's atmosphere and storytelling.</p>

                            <h3>2.5 Enemy AI and Behavior</h3>
                            <p>Enemy AI behavior can make or break the horror experience in a game. Implement intelligent AI that reacts realistically to the player's actions and environment. Create enemies with distinct behaviors and attack patterns, keeping players on their toes and constantly adapting to new threats. Unity's NavMesh system and behavior trees are powerful tools for creating complex enemy AI. Unity NavMesh Documentation, Unity Behavior Tree Documentation</p>

                            <p>A compelling story is the backbone of any great horror game. Develop a narrative that draws players in and keeps them engaged from start to finish.
